LinksCaddy – Organized Linear Map of Jira REST APIs and Services

LinkCaddy – A New Service for Jira Administrators and Developers. LinkCaddy simplifies working with Jira REST APIs by listing all available API calls that don't require IDs or keys. For example, the generic endpoint GET rest/api/2/field retrieves a list of all custom fields. With LinkCaddy, exploring and integrating Jira (Cloud and DC) APIs and services becomes easier. It provides access to most API-ready data and Jira services, empowering developers and administrators to use and automate Jira with ease and efficiency. To use LinkCaddy with your Data Center or Cloud Jira, simply enter your site's base URL or IP address. All service links will be updated automatically, providing direct access points.
